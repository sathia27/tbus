TBus is script used to see bus routes inside cities.

Now this script is available for cities of bangalore and chennai.

This is not an offline application. It uses internet.

Nokogiri, which is HTML parser library of ruby, scraps data from wiki pages below

Simple Installation

sudo apt-get install ruby libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt-dev ruby-dev

sudo apt-get install rubygems

sudo gem install nokogiri

and then you can run ruby file.
See the output below
